/* A banking application needs to process deposits and withdrawals. Every transaction contains a type and an amount.
Deposit
{
    type: "deposit",
    amount: 2000
}
Withdrawal
{
    type: "withdraw",
    amount: 1500
}
Task
Create a function named processTransaction. It should receive the current account balance and a transaction, and return the new balance.
Rules
A deposit increases the balance.
A withdrawal decreases the balance.
A customer cannot withdraw more money than they currently have — in that case, the original balance should remain unchanged.
TypeScript Requirement
Represent the two possible transaction shapes using TypeScript's type system. The function should not accept arbitrary transaction types.
